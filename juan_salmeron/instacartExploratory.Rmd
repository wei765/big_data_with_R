### Order products

`order_products__*.csv`

These files specify which products were purchased in each order.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM order_products__prior_tbl LIMIT 10")
```
 
## orders

`orders.csv`

This file tells to which set (prior, train, test) an order belongs. 


```{r}
orders_prev <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM orders_tbl LIMIT 100")
orders_prev
```
 
```{r}
dbGetQuery(
  sc,
  "
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) AS products
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
  "
  )
```

```{r}
products_popularity_txt <- "
SELECT product_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n_orders
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY n_orders DESC
LIMIT 50
"

products_popularity <-
  dbGetQuery(sc, products_popularity_txt)

products_popularity

## Products

`products.csv`

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM products_tbl LIMIT 20")

products <-
  dbGetQuery(sc, products_txt)

* What is the most popular department? 

## Whisker, magrittr

data <- list(productId = 24852)

product_times_ordered_txt %>%
  whisker.render(data) %>%
  cat
```
```{r}

  whisker.render(data) %>%
  dbGetQuery(sc, .) %>%

```

## Questions

* For given department, plot the most popular product (with templating department).
* For given day, rank department popularity.
