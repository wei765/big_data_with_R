Exercise

* Translate from SQL to dply or from dply to SQL
```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Match
LIMIT 6
")

games %>%head
```



```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT country_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n
FROM Match
GROUP BY country_id
ORDER BY n DESC
")

games %>% group_by(country_id) %>% summarise(nsample=n()) %>%arrange(desc(nsample))
```


```{r}
countries
```


```{r}
games %>%
  left_join(countries, by=c("country_id" = "id")) %>%
  select(name, home_team_api_id) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(teams = n_distinct(home_team_api_id)) %>%
  arrange(desc(teams))
```



```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Player_Attributes
LIMIT 6
")

```

* From where do players with higest accuracy come from?

* Add team name and translate to dplyr

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT stage, home_team_api_id, home_team_goal
FROM Match
WHERE country_id = 1
AND season = '2008/2009'
ORDER BY stage
")
```
